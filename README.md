# Crowdfunding-ETL

## Project Overview 

Perform an ETL on a dataset and a data analysis by using SQL queries.



## Method
In this Challenge, Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks were used to extract and transform phases a dataset. Specifically, I extracted and transformed the backers’ contact information from a CSV file to create a DataFrame that was exported as a CSV file. 
During the load phase, the dataset was used to create an ERD and a table schema for creating a new table in the database. The CSV file that contains the backers’ information was uploaded into this table. 
Finally, a data analysis was performed using SQL queries.
